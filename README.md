# Enhancing Biomass Prediction: Advanced Modeling Techniques and Multicollinearity Resolution
AP-STATS Project Code:
-----------------------

1. Implemented robust variable selection strategies, including stepwise regression, ridge regression, and subset selection, to optimize model performance within a dataset featuring 14 predictor variables.

2. Demonstrated proficiency in handling multicollinearity challenges associated with the dataset.

3. Applied Principal Component Regression (PCR) to mitigate collinearity, comparing model fit and Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) against traditional Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression.

4. Utilized ridge regression to strike a balance between regularization and accuracy within a 5-predictor model.

5. Successfully improved model interpretability and resolved multicollinearity issues.

6. Attained an impressive R-squared value of 0.867 in the stepwise regression model, showcasing the ability to provide impactful insights and predictive accuracy.
